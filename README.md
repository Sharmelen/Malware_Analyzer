# Malware_Analyzer
Tools Used To Analyse A Group of Malwares

## Instructions To Use This Tool

1. First Install All The Packages in Python Environment as Stated in the requirements.txt
2. Make sure you have installed and additional tool called SSDEEP. You can install it by typing "sudo apt install ssdeep" 
3. Make Sure You Have an VIRUS TOTAL API KEY. Open the file name vtmatch.py and insert your api key at the API_KEY variable.    You can get the API KEY at https://developers.virustotal.com/reference they will explain how to get the api key
4. Once you have done all this you can start by running the main_app.py by issuing this command "python3 main_app.py"
5. The main_app.py will give you access to run all the tools.

## Brief Introduction For The Tools in This Program

1. filesize.py
  - This program takes samples and clasifies their file size in a range of categories
  - The input required for this tool is just the directory of the file i.e. /home/john_doe/malwarefiles/
  - The program should generate a pie chart 
  
2. vtmatch.py
  - This program takes samples and analyse them in Virus Total
  - This program might take a long time to run depending on how many malware you have in the file directory since it can only
    process 4 malware per minute(Virus Total Api Policy). So if you have 100 malware it might take roughly 25 minutes to run
  - In order to run this tool please open the vtmatch.py and provide your api key at variable API_KEY in line 16.
  - Once finished running you will get a two graphs one depicting Total Match in Virus Total and Number of Matches in Each
    Top 10 AV
  - The input required for this tool is just the directory of the file i.e. /home/john_doe/malwarefiles/

3. entropy_calculator.py
  - This tool will enable you to calculate the entropy value of single sample or multiple sample
  - When you run main_app.py and select number 3 it will give you 2 options 1. Scanning Multiple Samples or 2. Scanning 
    Single Sample
    - If you choose 1 the input required is directory of the file i.e. /home/john_doe/malwarefiles/
    - If you choose 2 the input required is the specific directory of the sample i.e. /home/john_doe/malwarefiles/sample1
    
4. imphash.py
  - This tool will enable you to get the imphash of each sample and classify the in a pie chart with same imphash
  - The input required for this tool is just the directory of the file i.e. /home/john_doe/malwarefiles/
  
5. similar_hash.py
  - This tool is used to calculate the similarity of files through hashing 2 types of hash are used SSDEEP and TLSH
  - When you run main_app.py and select 5 it will give you 2 options 1. SSDEEP or 2. TLSH
    - You can choose any one of them and the input requires is the sample directory i.e. /home/john_doe/malwarefiles/
  
6. yara_rules.py
  - This tool is used to check the samples that matches yara rules.
  - You can add a new yara rule file in the file named rules but make sure the yara file you created is correctly done and 
    has ".yara" extension.
  - The input required for this tool is just the directory of the file i.e. /home/john_doe/malwarefiles/ 
  
7. compilation_time.py
  - This tool is used to check the compilation time of samples
  - The input required for this tool is just the directory of the file i.e. /home/john_doe/malwarefiles/
  - You will get a pie chart classifiying the compilation year of the malware.
