# Malware_Analyzer
Tools Used To Analyse A Group of Malwares

## Instructions To Use This Tool

1. First Install All The Packages in Python Environment as Stated in the requirements.txt
2. Once you have downloaded this repo unzip the zipped rules file.
3. Make sure you have installed an additional tool called SSDEEP. You can install it by typing " sudo apt install ssdeep " 
4. Make Sure You Have an VIRUS TOTAL API KEY. Open the file name vtmatch.py and insert your api key at the API_KEY variable.    You can get the API KEY at https://developers.virustotal.com/reference they will explain how to get the api key.
5. Once you have done all this you can start by running the main_app.py by issuing this command "python3 main_app.py"
6. The main_app.py will run and generate a html report for you in report_gen folder
7. Make sure that every time you run the program you save the generated report contents into another folder or it will 
   overwrite the report that has been created previously
   
   
## Brief Introduction For The Tools in This Program

1. filesize.py
  - This program takes samples and clasifies their file size in a range of categories
  - The program should generate a bar chart that give size range of each file falls under
  
2. vtmatch.py
  - This program takes samples and analyse them in Virus Total
  - This program might take a long time to run depending on how many malware you have in the file directory since it can only
    process 4 malware per minute(Virus Total Api Policy). So if you have 100 malware it might take roughly 25 minutes to run
  - In order to run this tool please open the vtmatch.py and provide your api key at variable API_KEY in line 16.
  - Once finished running you will get a two graphs one depicting Total Match in Virus Total and Number of Matches in Each
    Top 10 AV

3. entropy_calculator.py
  - This tool will enable you to calculate the entropy value of single sample or multiple sample
  - When you run main_app.py it will scan all the files in the directory you have provided and creates a barchart of score
    range where each malware falls under
  - You can also scan a specific malware file if you wish to have a detailed look.
    
4. imphash.py
  - This tool will enable you to get the imphash of each sample and classify the in a pie chart with same imphash
  - Once scanned and the imphash has been obtained it will generate a bar graph that groups malware with same imphash
  
  
5. similar_hash.py
  - This tool is used to calculate the similarity of files through hashing 2 types of hash are used SSDEEP and TLSH
  - When you run the program it will scan the similar hash of each file using TLSH and SSDEEP.
  - Once done a bar chart will be generated
  
6. yara_rules.py
  - This tool is used to check the samples that matches yara rules.
  - You can add a new yara rule file in the file named rules but make sure the yara file you created is correctly done and 
    has ".yara" extension.
  - Once scanned it will generate a bar chart 
  
7. compilation_time.py
  - This tool is used to check the compilation time of samples
  - The input required for this tool is just the directory of the file i.e. /home/john_doe/malwarefiles/
  - You will get a bar chart classifying the compilation year of each malware
  
8. report_generator.py
  - This tool will use the generated graphs from the previous tool and generate a full html report on the malware files that     you have scanned and so that you can have a better view of its attributes.
  - The html report generated will be stored in the report_gen folder 
  
## HAVE FUN ANALYZING MALWARES :-D!!!
